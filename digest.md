# Weekly ToC Digest (week of 2026-02-10)

> This batch reflects strong plasma physics research with emphasis on numerical methods, MHD simulations, and advanced computational frameworks. Many papers address multi-physics challenges in confinement fusion and space environments. Applied plasma modeling and gyrokinetic/kinetic solvers dominate the top tier. General AI and non-physics-centric computational papers are downweighted. Biology/materials science papers lacking plasma or extreme-physics context are excluded entirely. This batch is dominated by general-purpose AI/LLM research from arXiv AI with no domain-specific application to plasma physics, MHD, numerical methods, or space propulsion. Per scoring guidelines, papers lacking explicit connection to user interests (magnetohydrodynamics, plasma thrusters, PINNs, multi-physics simulation, agentic workflows for scientific discovery) are heavily down-weighted. Only 2 papers (Aster, GraphAgents) show marginal relevance via agentic scientific workflows; the remainder focus on NLP agents, behavioral modeling, and general machine learning without scientific computing applications. The single Nature item is a climate/geoscience summary unrelated to targeted interests. This batch comprises predominantly policy, social science, and biology-focused articles from Nature and Scientific Reports, with minimal technical R&D depth. No user interests or keywords were provided; triage applied default scoring calibration. The AIAA and aerospace papers scored highest for computational/e

arXiv:2602.07040v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce Aster, an AI agent for autonomous scientific discovery capable of operating over 20 times faster than existing frameworks. Given a task, an initial program, and a script to evaluate the performance of the program, Aster iteratively improves the program, often leading to new state-of-the-art performances. Aster's significant reduction in the number of iterations required for novel discovery expands the domain of tractable problems to in…

arXiv:2602.07491v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to accelerate discovery by reasoning across the expanding scientific landscape. Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of info…

arXiv:2602.07543v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Material synthesis planning (MSP) remains a fundamental and underexplored bottleneck in AI-driven materials discovery, as it requires not only identifying suitable precursor materials but also designing coherent sequences of synthesis operations to realize a target material. Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We…

Published: 2026-02-10T05:00:00+00:00
Tags: Scientific-Data, Pre-training, LLM-Foundations

arXiv:2602.07824v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Data quality determines foundation model performance, yet systematic processing frameworks are lacking. We introduce Data Darwinism, a ten-level taxonomy (L0-L9) that conceptualizes data-model co-evolution: advanced models produce superior data for next-generation systems. We validate this on scientific literature by constructing Darwin-Science, a 900B-token corpus (L0-L5). We identify a learnability gap in raw scientific text, which we bridge via …

arXiv:2602.07943v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In the presence of confounding between an endogenous variable and the outcome, instrumental variables (IVs) are used to isolate the causal effect of the endogenous variable. Identifying valid instruments requires interdisciplinary knowledge, creativity, and contextual understanding, making it a non-trivial task. In this paper, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can aid in this task. We perform a two-stage evaluation framework. Firs…

arXiv:2602.07755v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The statelessness of foundation models bottlenecks agentic systems' ability to continually learn, a core capability for long-horizon reasoning and adaptation. To address this limitation, agentic systems commonly incorporate memory modules to retain and reuse past experience, aiming for continual learning during test time. However, most existing memory designs are human-crafted and fixed, which limits their ability to adapt to the diversity and non-…
