# Weekly ToC Digest (week of 2026-02-16)

> This batch spans 47 papers across plasma physics, computational physics, and AI/agents. Three papers directly address plasma simulation methods using modern numerical frameworks: tensor network compression for Vlasov-Poisson (two duplicates), structure-preserving discrete gradients for kinetic systems, and moment closure models—all relevant to MHD solver development. One paper on MHD instabilities in tokamak disruption mitigation is moderately relevant. Several papers on agents (web browsing, inventory control, reasoning models, skill benchmarking) provide insights into agentic R&D automation patterns, though without domain-specific scientific application. The batch lacks papers directly addressing applied MPD thruster physics or non-ideal MHD effects in propulsion; most plasma papers focus on fusion confinement, astrophysical shocks, or fundamental kinetic theory without propulsion context. One paper directly addresses agentic workflows for physics simulation code generation with self-reflection mechanisms; another presents a PINN-based approach to the Nirenberg problem, demonstrating physics-informed neural network utility. The batch is dominated by general-purpose AI (LLMs, RL, diffusion models) and machine learning fundamentals with minimal overlap to MHD, plasma propulsion, or computational physics. No papers on thruster design, non-ideal MHD effects, or spacecraft control systems were identified. This batch is heavily dominated by general machine learning and multi-agen
