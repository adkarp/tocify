  "notes": "Three papers address advanced plasma simulation methods (tensor networks, discrete gradients, PIC schemes) with scores 0.76–0.77, directly supporting computational plasma modeling. Five tokamak/fusion papers (scores 0.61–0.78) cover MHD instabilities, confinement, and magnetized physics core to propulsion design. Remaining papers span rare-event sampling, quantum methods, and materials processing with minimal thruster relevance. This batch lacks papers directly targeting MHD, plasma propulsion, or scientific machine learning (SciML). The highest-scoring item (0.68) addresses aerospace optimal control but is disconnected from magnetohydrodynamic effects. Several papers explore agentic LLM systems (scores 0.42–0.62), which marginally align with R&D acceleration workflows but lack domain specificity in physics simulation or thruster design. Two papers directly relevant to agentic R&D pipelines: perceptual self-reflection in physics simulation code generation (0.88) and OptiML framework for CUDA kernel synthesis (0.76). One moderately relevant agentic architecture overview on skill-equipped LLM agents (0.72). Majority of batch comprises general-purpose AI/ML papers (NLP, vision, finance, e-commerce, medical imaging) with minimal or zero relevance to MHD, plasma propulsion, or computational physics. Top-ranked papers feature SciML methods (PINNs, Gaussian processes) and RL-driven design synthesis applicable to MHD optimization and agentic R&D acceleration. Most remaining items lac",
